# Apache-Beam-pipeline-using-java

Apache Beam is an evolution of the Dataflow model created by Google to process massive amounts of data. The name Beam (Batch + strEAM) comes from the idea of having a unified model for both batch and stream data processing. Programs written using Beam can be executed in different processing frameworks (via runners) using a set of different IOs.

In this code,implementing Hospital Charges Data Analysis in the United States.
We will do our analysis using Apache Beamâ€™s Java BeamSql API and will execute the code in Google Dataflow runner to solve the below problems :
Problem 1: Find the amount of Average Covered Charges per state.
Problem 2: Find the amount of Average Medicare Payments charges per state.
Problem 3: Find out the total number of Discharges per state and for each disease.
